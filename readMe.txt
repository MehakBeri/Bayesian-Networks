1) All code has been written in Java and is placed in the "program" folder. The report and other documentation is present in "result" folder.
2) To run first part (Independent Bayesian Networks), go into programs folder and type "javac independentBN.java" and then "java independentBN"
3) To run second part (Tree Bayesian Networks), go into programs folder and type "javac maxSt_dfs.java", then "javac chowliu.java" and then "java chowliu"
4) To run third part (Mixtures of Tree Bayesian networks using EM), go into programs folder and type "javac EM.java" and then "java EM". Enter value of k (=5 , because I found this value of k by experimenting on the validation data)
5) To run fourth part (Mixtures of Tree Bayesian networks using Bagging), go into programs folder and type "javac bagging_treeBN.java" and then "java bagging_treeBN". Enter value of k (=20 , because I found this value of k by experimenting on the validation data)
6) the mean and standard deviation calculations as well as the readings for the 10 iterations have been recorded in the excel sheet named "mean_sd"
